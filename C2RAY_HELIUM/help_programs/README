Use the file my_cross_section2.m for receving the fitting paramters for different frequency bins for the cross sections. They are written in the prompt in a formatted way so that they can be copied immediately to the correct places in radiation. The only thing that has to be given are the frequency bin boundaries. This program also gives the parameters for the secondary ionizations, implemented according to Riccotti et al.
Use cooling_data.m to get plots of the cooling rates that we are using compared to other references.
 The other two files, units and cross_section contain stuff needed by my_cross_section2.m. Cooling_rates_our_tables.mat contains the table data from the cooling tables we are using.
